# Predicting-the-Sale-Price-of-Bulldozers-using-Machine-Learning
predicting the future sale price of a bulldozer, given its characteristics and previous examples of how much similar bulldozers have been sold for. It is a regression problem.

Certainly! Here is a detailed explanation of the steps followed in the project:

Problem Definition: Predicting the sale price of Bulldozer using Machine Learning.

Data Collection: The dataset is downloaded from the Kaggle Bluebook for Bulldozers competition. The data is divided into three parts train.csv , test.csv, validation.csv.

Data Exploration and Analysis: Once the data was collected, exploratory data analysis (EDA) was performed to gain insights into the datasets. This involved tasks such as examining data distributions, identifying missing values, visualizing relationships between variables, and understanding the data's overall structure.

Data Preprocessing: Preprocessing the data was crucial to ensure its quality and suitability for model training. This step included handling missing values by imputation or removal, encoding categorical variables, scaling numerical features, and possibly feature engineering to create new informative variables.

Model Selection: With preprocessed data in hand, various machine learning models were considered for predicting bulldozer prices. This could include linear regression, decision trees, random forests, gradient boosting machines, and more complex ensemble methods.

Model Training: After selecting candidate models, they were trained on the preprocessed training data. This involved splitting the data into training and validation sets to assess model performance. During training, hyperparameters may be tuned to optimize model performance using techniques like grid search or randomized search.

Model Evaluation: Trained models were evaluated using appropriate evaluation metrics such as mean absolute error (MAE), root mean squared error (RMSE), and R-squared. Performance on both the training and validation datasets was assessed to ensure the model's generalization ability. 

Validation:- Validating our model on a subset to tune Hyperparameters. Performed Hyperparameter tuning with RandomizedSearchCV.

Testing: Making Predictions on test data.
